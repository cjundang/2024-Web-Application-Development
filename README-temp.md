---

## Weeks 1-6: Basic Concepts

**Week 1: Introduction to Web Architecture**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Overview of three-tier architecture (Presentation, Logic, and Data tiers)
  - Front-end vs. back-end roles in web applications
  - Database interactions and data flow in a typical web application
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Set up a basic HTML file and view it in a browser.
  - Create a simple structure showing front-end and back-end divisions with basic HTML and comments.
  - Basic server setup (Node.js or another preferred server framework) for handling client requests.

**Week 2: HTTP Protocol**
- **Subtopics:**
  - HTTP request-response cycle, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Understanding HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500) and headers
  - RESTful API design and principles
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Use `fetch` API or a similar tool to make GET and POST requests to a simple server.
  - Practice handling HTTP responses and parsing JSON data.
  - Create a mini API server (e.g., in Node.js) to handle GET/POST requests and return data.


## Week 3: HTML5
 

**Week 4: CSS3**
- **Subtopics:**
  - CSS fundamentals: selectors, properties, and values
  - Layout techniques (flexbox and grid) for creating responsive designs
  - Styling forms, buttons, and navigation bars
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Style the HTML page from Week 3 using CSS (add colors, font sizes, spacing).
  - Use flexbox or grid layout to create a responsive layout for the page.
  - Create and style a simple navigation bar.

**Week 5: JavaScript & JSON**
- **Subtopics:**
  - JavaScript basics: variables, functions, and event handling
  - Manipulating the DOM to create interactive elements
  - Understanding JSON structure and parsing JSON in JavaScript
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Add JavaScript to the previous project to make elements interactive (e.g., a button that toggles visibility).
  - Create a script to load JSON data and display it dynamically on the webpage.
  - Use event listeners to handle user interactions (e.g., form submission).

**Week 6: Responsive Web Design & Web API**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Using media queries to adapt designs for different screen sizes
  - Introduction to external APIs and data fetching
  - Displaying API data on the front end
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Update previous pages to be fully responsive using CSS media queries.
  - Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and display it on the page.
  - Implement error handling for API calls and display appropriate messages to users.

### Weeks 7-9: React Fundamentals

**Week 7: JSX and Component-Based Architecture**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Introduction to JSX syntax and compiling it with Babel
  - Building components in React and organizing them
  - Hierarchical structuring and reusability of components
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Set up a basic React project and create a few components (e.g., `Header`, `Footer`, `MainContent`).
  - Render these components within an `App` component.
  - Use JSX to add dynamic content (e.g., display current date/time).

**Week 8: State and Props**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Understanding `useState` for managing local component states
  - Passing data between components using props
  - Conditional rendering based on state or props
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Build a simple to-do list or counter application using `useState`.
  - Pass data as props from a parent component to children and render it.
  - Implement conditional rendering (e.g., show a message when a list is empty).

**Week 9: React Lifecycle & Hooks**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Understanding React’s component lifecycle (mounting, updating, unmounting)
  - Using `useEffect` for side effects (e.g., data fetching, DOM manipulation)
  - Cleaning up side effects to avoid memory leaks
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Use `useEffect` to fetch data from an API when a component mounts.
  - Create a live search component that fetches data based on input.
  - Practice cleaning up `useEffect` to prevent issues when components unmount.

### Weeks 10-13: Next.js Framework & Term Project

**Week 10: File-based Routing**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Introduction to Next.js file-based routing and creating pages
  - Navigating between pages with Next.js Link component
  - Dynamic routing and query parameters
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Create a multi-page Next.js application (e.g., home, about, contact).
  - Implement dynamic routing (e.g., `/user/[id]` to display user profiles).
  - Use `Link` to navigate between pages and pass query parameters.

**Week 11: Image Optimization**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Next.js Image component for optimized loading and responsive sizing
  - Benefits of image optimization for performance
  - Using external image sources with Next.js
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Add optimized images to the Next.js project using the Image component.
  - Implement responsive image sizes based on viewport width.
  - Experiment with serving images from external sources and observe performance gains.

**Week 12: Server-Side and Static-Site Rendering**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs. Static Site Generation (SSG)
  - When to use SSR vs. SSG for performance optimization
  - Using `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` in Next.js
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Set up SSR for a page that fetches real-time data.
  - Implement SSG for static content that doesn’t require frequent updates.
  - Experiment with incremental static regeneration for partially static content.

**Week 13: Term Project**
- **Subtopics:**
  - Integrating React and Next.js concepts into a cohesive project
  - Planning and organizing components and page structure
  - Presentation and code review
- **Programming Exercises:**
  - Students work on a final project (e.g., a blog, portfolio, or e-commerce prototype) using React and Next.js.
  - Implement routing, API calls, image optimization, and SSR/SSG where applicable.
  - Present the project, focusing on component design, optimization strategies, and use of Next.js features.
